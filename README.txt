This archive contains the code files used in the PhD thesis of Cyrus James Grahame Legg
and which form an annex to the thesis. 
The thesis was pubished by UCL but these files were not, 
owing to a confilict of licene terms applied there with the GPL3 license
under which these files are published here. 

The code files are copyright CJG Legg 2024, except where they are derived from
the QuickSched project, where of course the original copyright belongs to 
the original authors, Pedro Gonnet et al, with the modifications being mine. 

QuickSched can be found at https://sourceforge.net/projects/quicksched/
